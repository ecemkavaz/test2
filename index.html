            <h4>Details of the study:</h4>

This study is an interdisciplinary study between linguists and computer scientists that is designed to support linguistic team to analyse their annotated corpus with data visualisations. Their corpus is designed to examine toxic messages occurring on comment sections of digital newspapers. We have designed a data visualisation tool that aims to analyse their toxic messages corpus easily and efficiently. To evaluate our tool, we will give you some tasks and ask you to interact with our visualisation tool to complete these tasks. At the end of each tasks we will ask you to answer some questions and at the end we will ask you some subjective questions regarding your experience. We will then aggregate the collected data to draw conclusions on the abilities of our tool.

            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 50px">

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
You will be presented with the visualisation tool and X number of tasks that you have to complete. Please interact with the tool to answer the questions that are given in the tasks.

The expected duration of the evaluation is 30-35 minutes.

            </p>
